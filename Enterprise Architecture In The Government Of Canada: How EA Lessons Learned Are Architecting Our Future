This webinar, hosted by The Open Group, is part of a series of webinars from The Open Group Government EA Work Group.

This particular presentation will start with an overview of the recent history of Enterprise Architecture in the Government of Canada. This will be followed by the environmental drivers for change and the newly issued formal Government of Canada EA Guidance.

The use of Agile Enterprise Architecture for agile procurements will be discussed in the light of several major projects underway. The presentation will culminate in a set of lessons learned including making stakeholders realize that they are already doing Enterprise Architecture and this facilitates Enterprise Architecture implementation. A Q&A session will follow at the end of the webinar.
